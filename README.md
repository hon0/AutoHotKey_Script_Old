# AutoHotKey_Script

My objective is to learn AutoHotKey Script so I can remap any keyboard, keypad, mouse, joystick etc.. Without being dependant on their native software.

I'll still use JoyGremlin and/or UCR to Manage Joystick Axis and button.
My AutoHotKey Script will come on top of it mostly to allow controller X + controller Y combinaison.
Keyboard + mouse, Joystick + mouse. Whatever..
